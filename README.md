Clementine Client
=================

A Node.js library for interfacing with the [Clementine Music Player](https://www.clementine-player.org/).

This is as ES6 fork of emersion's [clementine-remote package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clementine-remote) that *only* implements a bare-bones client (I.E. no library, server or browser support).

Requirements
------------

### Node.js 7+

 * OSX: `brew install node` using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
 * Linux: `apt install nodejs` ([see Ubuntu/Debian specific instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)) or `pacman -S nodejs` (Arch Linux)
 * Windows: [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Installation
------------

 * `npm install clementine-client`

Example
-------

```js
// Dependencies
const ClementineClient = require('clementine-client')

// Create client
let client = new ClementineClient({host: '127.0.0.1', port: '5500', authCode: 2738})

// Bind events
client.on('connect', () => console.log('Connected!'))
client.on('error', (err) => console.error(err))
client.on('play', () => console.log('Playing')))

// Set volume to 50%
client.setVolume(50)

// Start playing
client.play()

```
